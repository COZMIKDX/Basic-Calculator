# Basic-Calculator
## This is a WIP
I wanted to do more quick and small projects and a basic calculator app is a good candidate for that.
Since I'm not on my PC, I'll be using VSCode.dev with the CodeSwing extension.
Typically I use codepen when I don't have my PC but I wanted to try CodeSwing again. Additionally, I would have a commit history by going this route, unlike on codepen.

For this project I wanted to play around with how I keep information like the result of calculation or the current operand being typed in by the user.
I think this is a somewhat common way of doing things in some frameworks like alpine.js
Instead of keeping JS variables with that info, I am grabbing the information from the HTML elements in the calculator.
The information I collect from the HTML elements are stored as strings until the calculation is executed when the user presses the equals button.

I intend on making a calculator in a way I would normally would, keeping all information in JS variables and updating the HTML with that information.
I am also interesting in trying to make an Alpine.js version. Remaking it like this will help me get a better understanding of why I might choose a framework
versus doing it all by scratch.
