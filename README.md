# Basic-Calculator
I wanted to do more quick and small projects and a basic calculator app is a good candidate for that.
Since I'm not on my PC, I'll be using VSCode.dev with the CodeSwing extension.
Typically I use codepen but I wanted to try CodeSwing again. Additionally, I would have a commit history by going this route, unlike on codepen.
